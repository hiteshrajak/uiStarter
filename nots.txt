Markup:-
				Markup is the combination of tags or elements that I'm using on the webpage.



Doctype :-
				The first tag that every HTML document has is the doctype,
				it's written like this <!doctype html> doctype defines what
				kind of HTML edition we are using on the webpage.
				
				HTML has been revised ever since it was launched in first edition.
				So it has a first edition, second edition, the third, the fourth
				and now the latest one is called HTML5.
				
				So if you write this <!doctype html> line, the browser is going 
				to know that we are using the HTML5 edition and when it processes 
				our HTML, it's going to use the latest definitions of HTML5 and
				render a page.
			
			
Strong tag :-
				Let's learn about the strong tag. Strong tag is simply the bold tag. If you 
				want to bold anything or certain words, you can simply write <strong>Any Word
				Here</strong> it will bold the text between the strong tag.
				
CSS reference:- To accomplish that we can create a link tag like and reference it like such 
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> .
				Now since the style.css file is in the CSS folder, we're going to write like such  
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"> save it, refresh the screen and you 
				get the same result.
				
meta charset= utf-8
what does it mean:-
				That meta tag basically specifies what character set is your website written with.
				... UTF-8 (U from Universal Character Set + Transformation Formatâ€”8-bit) is a 
				character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters (called code points)
				in Unicode. The encoding is variable-length and uses 8-bit code units
